| [PION]() | Jonathan Mackey (DIAS) | PION is a grid-based fluid dynamics code for hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, including a ray-tracing module for calculating the attenuation of radiation from point sources of ionizing photons. It also has a module for coupling fluid dynamics and the radiation field to microphysical processes such as heating/cooling and ionization/recombination. | [Mackey et. al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504..983M/abstract), [Mackey and Lim 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.403..714M/abstract) | C++ | BSD 3-Clause License | Public [Download](https://git.dias.ie/massive-stars-software/pion) 
| [PLUTO](https://plutocode.ph.unito.it/)          | Andrea Mignone and the PLUTO code development team  | PLUTO is a freely-distributed software for the numerical solution of mixed hyperbolic/parabolic systems of partial differential equations.         | [Mignone et. al. 2007](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJS..170..228M/abstract) | C | GNU, GPL | Public [Download](https://plutocode.ph.unito.it/download.html)
